I want to add:
start screen
A two player version, you can eat the other snake too
Easy, Medium and Hard (Depending on game-unit size, delay speed, initial size of snake, increase speed everytime you eat an apple), Timer mode, Minesweeper mode
Golden Apple = +2 points per apple and invincible for 5 seconds, increase speed
Inverse mode
Can cross through the outside walls
Bite of tail, if you get to the head you lose
Random apple (changes between normal, golden, poison apple, time apple)
Poison apple slows you down (unable to turn as fast), and lose points
